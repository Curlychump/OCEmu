OCEmu - OpenComputers Emulator
==============================
Forked from zenith391's Fork, original created by BlueAmulet
==============================

Fixes implemented in this version have only been tested with Windows and fixes may not apply to other operating systems
If you want to use OCemu with other OSs, please use [zenith391`s Fork](https://github.com/zenith391/OCEmu)

Installation
------------

I may add precompiled binaries later.

1. Clone this repository using: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Curlychump/OCEmu.git`
2. Download and install Msys2
3. Run ```msys2_setup_ocemu.sh``` in an msys2 environment. 
4. Run the compiled binary located in ```OCemu/src``` or using Lua in a terminal run ```boot.lua```

Running
-------
OCemu will leave its created files in `%appdata%/OCemu` by default.
If you want to run a seperate machine, you can add a directory as an argument while running ```boot.lua```
